If you watched the second [BUILD keynote](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/1-002) a few weeks ago you may have seen Satya mention a company called [Mural.ly](http://mural.ly). Mural.ly is an exciting new startup that runs their core services and infrastructure on Windows Azure. If you haven't seen Mural.ly I definitely recommend signing up for a free account and giving them a try. We were fortunate to have [Johnny Halife](https://twitter.com/johnnyhalife) in Redmond for BUILD where he participated in a few talks and interviews which you will find below.

From a developer prospective, Mural.ly is really doing some cool things. Their back-end services are built entirely in Node.js and use MongoDB hosted on MongoLab to store their data. On the front-end they have built an impressive HTML/JavaScript application that runs in all modern browsers. Additionally, the dev team is iterating about as fast as I have ever seen. They are doing upwards of 15-20 deployments every day into production using a sophisticated, yet fast CI setup that runs Jenkins on a Windows Azure Virtual Machine.

Below you will find several recordings from BUILD sessions and interviews where Johnny describes in detail how Mural.ly is built.
