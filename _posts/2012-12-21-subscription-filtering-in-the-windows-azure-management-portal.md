List night the Windows Azure Portal Team shipped another great update. This update includes a number of great features such as support for SQL Data Sync, ACS management, and improvements to virtual network management. However, my favorite feature - and surely to be a favorit of anyone who manages many subscriptions - is subscription filtering. You can now filter any view on the portal to show only services from a single or a group of subscriptions.
