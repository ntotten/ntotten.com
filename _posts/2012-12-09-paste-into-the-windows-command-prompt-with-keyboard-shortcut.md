[Paste into the Windows Command Prompt with Keyboard Shortcut](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/131955/keyboard-shortcut-to-paste-clipboard-content-into-command-prompt-window-win-xp)

Just found this simple tool called [AutoHotKey ](http://www.autohotkey.com/)that allows you to create simple automation scripts including using [Ctrl+V to paste into the Command Prompt](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/131955/keyboard-shortcut-to-paste-clipboard-content-into-command-prompt-window-win-xp). This will save me a lot of time and will make a lot of demos much easier as I wont have to switch from keyboard to mouse just to paste a line of text.
