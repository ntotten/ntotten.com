If you had a chance to watch the [Windows Azure Web Site session](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/windowsazure/Learn-2012TechEd-EU/WebSites) at [Learn Windows Azure](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/windowsazure) you may have noticed an application used in the demos called Cloud Survey. The Cloud Survey sample is a modern web application that is build using [ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4), [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview), [SignalR](http://signalr.net/), and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). This application is designed to be deployed and run on [Windows Azure Web Sites](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/) and uses [SQL Databases](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/data-management/) for persistence.

Today, I have published the entire source of the Cloud Survey application to [Github](https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/CloudSurvey) and made it available under the Apache license. You can get download the source [directly from Github](https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/CloudSurvey). You can also see a [live demo](http://cloudsurvey.azurewebsites.net) of the site deployed to Windows Azure Web Sites (username: admin; password: Contoso123!).

Additionally, I have recorded a screencast demonstrating and explaining the various features of the Cloud Survey application.
