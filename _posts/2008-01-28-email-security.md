I just ran across a great tool to help you verify the identity email senders. This tool is called iconix ([http://www.iconix.com/](http://www.iconix.com/)). Basically, this company has teamed up with companies like PayPal, Wells Fargo, Netflix, and about 350 others to provided verification of the email addressed. So, if you receive an email from your bank, say Wells Fargo, iconix will validate that email to ensure it is legitimate. It is very simple and easy to use. It is compatible with almost every major email service and software. Best of all it is completely **FREE** for the end user. Try it out and let me know your experience.
