title: Visual Studio 2012 Presentation Mode
categories:

---

This week I gave several presentations at [Microsoft Web Camps](http://www.devcamps.ms/web). Part of giving a presentation involves setting up your machine properly to ensure that everyone can read the text on the screen. This is generally something I have done manually in Visual Studio by modifying the font settings. However, a few days ago [Mads Kristensen](http://madskristensen.net/) pointed out to me that the new [Visual Studio 2012 Productivity Power Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271503) have a fantastic command to automate this task. Now to setup Visual Studio for a demo all I have to do is type "PresentOn" in the top right search bar. To disable presentation mode, just type "PresentOff".
