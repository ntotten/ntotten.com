Recently, I created a API wrapper for [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/?referrer=ATLASBAY). I built this to create a web application that interacts with basecamp (more on that shortly). Today, I decided that to open source the basecamp API and post it on Google Code. I have also started working on an API for [Highrise](http://highrisehq.com/?referrer=ATLASBAY) and have plans for the other 37Signals products as well. So if you are a .Net developer and you are interested in integrating your product with 37Signals check this out. You can browse the source or download and build this project [here](http://code.google.com/p/37signalsdotnet/). I havenâ€™t quite finished up coding or testing yet, so be careful if you want to use this in a production environment.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
