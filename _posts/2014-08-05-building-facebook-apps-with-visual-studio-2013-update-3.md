title: Building Facebooks apps with Visual Studio 2013 Update 3
description: 
---

Yesterday, Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 was released bringing another good set of changes. One of the changes that the ASP.NET announced was how they will ship the Facebook App Template. Instead of shipping this template inside of Visual Studio, this will now ship as a NuGet package as well as a Visual Studio Extension. While this makes getting started slightly more complicated, the bennifit is that the team can now update these tools more frequently than the 3-4 month Visual Studio cycle.
