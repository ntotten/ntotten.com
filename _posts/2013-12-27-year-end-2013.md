I haven't blogged much in the last 6 months so I though I would write a quick post on some news and updates as the year comes to an end. First, the main reason I haven't been blogging is because I have changed roles on the Windows Azure team. Back in July I took a position on the Windows Azure Engineering team as a Program Manager. Unfortunately, I don't have anything to share just yet about what I am working on, but you can be assured that when the time comes I will post some updates here.

Additionally, I wanted to point you to a new company, called [Opsgility](http://opsgility.com), that provides various Windows Azure trainings. Opsgility was founded by [Michael Washam](http://michaelwasham.com) who was my teammate on the Windows Azure Evangelism Team. Michael decided to move back to Texas and start up his own company. While we were sad to see him leave Microsoft, I am pleased that he is still part of the Windows Azure family. If you or your company are looking for some excellent Windows Azure training, definitely look them up.

Happy Holiday and New Year to everyone and I look forward to continue to writing about the latest news and features on Windows Azure.
