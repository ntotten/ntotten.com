I added another tutorial to the Facebook C# SDK documentation. This tutorial shows you how to create a ASP.NET MVC 3 Website that uses the Facebook Javascript SDK to handle client side authentication and the Facebook C# SDK to handle server side authentication and API calls. The tutorial is available [here](http://csharpsdk.org/docs/web/).
