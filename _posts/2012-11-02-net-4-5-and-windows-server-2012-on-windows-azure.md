title: .Net 4.5 and Windows Server 2012 on Windows Azure
categories:

In case you missed the [announcements at BUILD](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/1-002) this week, we now support .Net 4.5 on both Windows Azure Web Sites and Cloud Services. Additionally, Cloud Services has a new OS version 3 that runs Windows Server 2012. I'll write up a more detailed post shortly, but if you were waiting for the ability to use async/await, Web Sockets, or any of the many new features in .Net 4.5 or Server 2012 in the cloud you can now do so!
